#termcolors.py

A simple script to quickly switch between color themes in urxvt.

##Setup
1. Requires 'xrdb'
2. Theme files are .Xresources format, should be located in ~/.config/xresources/ and have no file extensions.
3. Remove all color settings from ~/.Xresources


Included are some themes I like from http://dotshare.it

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/xresources
cp xresources/* ~/.config/xresources/
```

TODO:
    - browse and preview themes from dotshare.it
    - download and auto format themefiles
    - adjust transparency setting in themefiles
